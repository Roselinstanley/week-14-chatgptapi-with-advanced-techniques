      "    *   Two consecutive faults (\"double fault\") result in the server losing the point.\n",
      "    *   A **let** occurs if the serve hits the net cord but still lands in the correct service box. It's a re-serve, no penalty.\n",
      "    *   A **foot fault** occurs if the server steps on or over the baseline before hitting the ball. It's a fault.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Playing the Ball:**\n",
      "    *   After a valid serve, players must hit the ball back over the net into the opponent's court.\n",
      "    *   The ball can only bounce once on your side of the court before you hit it. If it bounces twice, you lose the point.\n",
      "    *   You cannot hit the net with your body or racket while the ball is in play.\n",
      "    *   The ball must land within the lines of the court to be \"in.\" If it lands outside the lines, it's \"out\" and the player who hit it loses the point.\n",
      "    *   If the ball hits the net during a rally (not a serve) and goes over into the opponent's court, it's still in play.\n",
